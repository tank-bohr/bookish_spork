An erlang library to test http requests. Inspired by Ruby's [WebMock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock).

Suitable for Elixir.

## Rationale


There are several ways to test your http interaction

* Real http request to real servers: not very reliable, requires internet

* You can use external http server like [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) (hackney approach)

* You can mock your http client library

* Also you can run an http-server within your application on your localhost on a particualr port

The last approach is the best IMHO. It is absolutely http-client agnostic. It doesn't require internet connection or any external utilities.

bookish_spork provides you facilities to test your requests with *real* http server.


## Usage

Bookish spork supports Erlang/OTP 20.3 or later.

First step: add to your rebar config

```erlang
{profiles, [
    {test, [
        {deps, [
            {bookish_spork, "0.2.0"}
        ]}
    ]}
]}.
```

Second: start server in your tests.

```erlang
bookish_spork:start_server().
```

It starts process without link. Thus you can use it in `init_per_group` and in `init_per_suite` callbacks. Default port is 32002 but you can specify any port you like with `bookish_spork:start_server/1`


### Stub request

The simplest stub you can do is

```erlang
bookish_spork:stub_request().
```

It will stub your requests with `204 No Content` response with empty body.

If you need specify response you easily can do this:


```erlang
bookish_spork:stub_request(Status, Headers, Content).
```


### Capture request

As usual the main goal is to test that you send the correct request


```erlang
{ok, Request} = bookish_spork:capture_request().
```

It returns you an opaque structure of the request. You can inspect it with

- `bookish_spork_request:method/1`
- `bookish_spork_request:uri/1`
- `bookish_spork_request:headers/1`
- `bookish_spork_request:body/1`


## Bypass comparision

An elixir library [bypass](https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/bypass) does pretty much the same. And illustrates the same approach. It starts a cowboy web-server to replace a real service for test

But bookish_spork has some advantages:

- Bypass depends on `cowboy` and `plug`. Bookish spork has zero dependencies
- Bookish spork works seamlessly with both erlang and elixir. Bypass is supposed to be an elixir only library
- Bookish spork much simpler

## Examples

Setup and teardown

```erlang
init_per_group(_GroupName, Config) ->
    {ok, _} = bookish_spork:start_server(),
    Config.

end_per_group(_GroupName, _Config) ->
    ok = bookish_spork:stop_server().
```

Set expectation

```erlang
init_per_testcase(random_test, Config) ->
    bookish_spork:stub_request(200,
        <<"{\"value\": \"Chuck Norris' favourite word: chunk.\"}">>),
    Config.
```

Make assertions

```erlang
random_test(_Config) ->
    ?assertEqual(<<"Chuck Norris' favourite word: chunk.">>, testee:make_request()),
    {ok, Request} = bookish_spork:capture_request(),
    ?assertEqual("/jokes/random", bookish_spork_request:uri(Request)).
```

As you can see there are two types of assertions:

- we check a testee function result

- we check a side effect: verifying outgoing request has correct parameters (uri in this case)


### More complex expectations

There are cases when the testee function initiates more than one request. But if you know the order of your requests, you can set several expectations

```erlang
bookish_spork:stub_request(200, <<"{\"value\": \"The first response\"}">>),
bookish_spork:stub_request(200, <<"{\"value\": \"The second response\"}">>).
```

The library will response in the order the stubs were defined.


Sometimes you can't guarantee the order of requests. Then you may stub request with the fun

```erlang
bookish_spork:stub_request(fun(Request) ->
    case bookish_spork_request:uri(Request) of
        "/bookish/spork" ->
            bookish_spork_response:new(200, <<"Hello">>);
        "/admin/sporks" ->
            bookish_spork_response:new(403, <<"It is not possible here">>)
    end
end)
```

### Elixir example


```elixir
defmodule ChuckNorrisApiTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  doctest ChuckNorrisApi

  setup_all do
    {:ok, _} = :bookish_spork.start_server
    {:ok, %{}}
  end

  test "retrieves a random joke" do
    :bookish_spork.stub_request(200, "{
      \"value\": \"Chuck norris tried to crank that soulja boy but it wouldn't crank up\"
    }")
    assert ChuckNorrisApi.random == "Chuck norris tried to crank that soulja boy but it wouldn't crank up"

    {:ok, request} = :bookish_spork.capture_request
    assert :bookish_spork_request.uri(request) == '/jokes/random'
  end
end

```
