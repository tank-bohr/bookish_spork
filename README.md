An erlang library to test http requests. Inspired by Ruby's [WebMock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock).

Suitable for Elixir.

### <a name="Rationale">Rationale</a> ###

There are several ways to test your http interaction

- Real http request to real servers: not very reliable, requires internet

- You can use external http server like [`https://httpbin.org/`](https://httpbin.org/) (hackney approach)

- You can mock your http client library

- Also you can run an http-server within your application on your localhost on a particualr port

The last approach is the best IMHO. It is absolutely http-client agnostic. It doesn't require internet connection or any external utilities.

bookish_spork provides you facilities to test your requests with *real* http server.


### <a name="Usage">Usage</a> ###

Bookish spork supports Erlang/OTP 20.3 or later.

First step: add to your rebar config

```erlang

{profiles, [
    {test, [
        {deps, [
            {bookish_spork, "0.2.5"}
        ]}
    ]}
]}.
```

Second: start server in your tests.

```erlang

bookish_spork:start_server().

```

It starts process without link. Thus you can use it in `init_per_group` and in `init_per_suite` callbacks. Default port is 32002 but you can specify any port you like with `bookish_spork:start_server/1`


#### <a name="Stub_request">Stub request</a> ####

The simplest stub you can do is

```erlang

bookish_spork:stub_request().

```

It will stub your requests with `204 No Content` response with empty body.

If you need specify response you easily can do this:

```erlang

bookish_spork:stub_request(Status, Headers, Content).

```


#### <a name="Capture_request">Capture request</a> ####

As usual the main goal is to test that you send the correct request

```erlang

{ok, equest} = bookish_spork:capture_request().

```

It returns you an opaque structure of the request. You can inspect it with

- [`bookish_spork_request:method/1`](http://github.com/tank-bohr/bookish_spork/blob/master/doc/bookish_spork_request.md#method-1)

- [`bookish_spork_request:uri/1`](http://github.com/tank-bohr/bookish_spork/blob/master/doc/bookish_spork_request.md#uri-1)

- [`bookish_spork_request:headers/1`](http://github.com/tank-bohr/bookish_spork/blob/master/doc/bookish_spork_request.md#headers-1)

- [`bookish_spork_request:body/1`](http://github.com/tank-bohr/bookish_spork/blob/master/doc/bookish_spork_request.md#body-1)


#### <a name="Bypass_comparision">Bypass comparision</a> ####

An elixir library [bypass](https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/bypass) does pretty much the same. And illustrates the same approach. It starts a cowboy web-server to replace a real service for test

But bookish_spork has some advantages:

- Bypass depends on `cowboy` and `plug`. Bookish spork has zero dependencies

- Bookish spork works seamlessly with both erlang and elixir. Bypass is supposed to be an elixir only library

- Bookish spork much simpler


#### <a name="Examples">Examples</a> ####

Setup and teardown

```erlang

init_per_group(_GroupName, Config) ->
    {ok, _} = bookish_spork:start_server(),
    Config.

end_per_group(_GroupName, _Config) ->
    ok = bookish_spork:stop_server().

```

Set expectation

```erlang
init_per_testcase(random_test, Config) ->
    bookish_spork:stub_request(200,
        <<"{\"value\": \"Chuck Norris' favourite word: chunk.\"}">>),
    Config.

```

Make assertions

```erlang
random_test(_Config) ->
    ?assertEqual(<<"Chuck Norris' favourite word: chunk.">>, testee:make_request()),
    {ok, Request} = bookish_spork:capture_request(),
    ?ssertEqual("/jokes/random", bookish_spork_request:uri(Request)).

```

As you can see there are two types of assertions:

- we check a testee function result

- we check a side effect: verifying outgoing request has correct attributes (uri in this case)

<h5><a name="More_complex_expectations">More complex expectations</a></h5>

There are cases when the testee function initiates more than one request. But if you know the order of your requests, you can set several expectations

```erlang
bookish_spork:stub_request(200, <<"{\"value\": \"The first response\"}">>),
bookish_spork:stub_request(200, <<"{\"value\": \"The second response\"}">>).

```

The library will response in the order the stubs were defined.

Sometimes you can't guarantee the order of requests. Then you may stub request with the fun

```erlang
bookish_spork:stub_request(fun(Request) ->
    case bookish_spork_request:uri(Request) of
        "/bookish/spork" ->
            bookish_spork_response:new(200, <<"Hello">>);
        "/admin/sporks" ->
            bookish_spork_response:new(403, <<"It is not possible here">>)
    end
end

```

  test "retrieves a random joke" do

      \"value\": \"Chuck norris tried to crank that soulja boy but it wouldn't crank up\"
    }")
    assert ChuckNorrisApi.random == "Chuck norris tried to crank that soulja boy but it wouldn't crank up"

    {:ok, request} = :bookish_spork.capture_request
    assert :bookish_spork_request.uri(request) == '/jokes/random'
  end
end
